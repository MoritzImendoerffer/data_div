# Perveiced Temparture and Humidtiy 

During hot periods of the year, various tips and tricks are published how to cope with extreme heat, especially in urban environments. One of those proposed tricks is  to hang up wet towels in order to cool the room through evaporation. However, perceived temperature depends on the humidity too. So, would it help to hang up towels during a hot day or would it make the situation worse? If it helps, how many towels should I hang up? How wet should they be?

The [heatindex](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitzeindex) describes the quantitative relationship between perceived temperature and humidity. According to wikipedia, it is applicable for temperatures above 26.7Â°C and 40 % relative humidity.

[Relative humidity](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftfeuchtigkeit#Relative_Luftfeuchtigkeit) (German version of wikipedia is surprisingly better for this article) can be calculated based on the air pressure and the [saturation pressure of water in air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapour_pressure_of_water)
